# Task 2 : Synchronous ram 

using verilog and system verilog Specification: The true port dual ram Contains of two independent port A and B.Data can be write and read by both port and single port.Read and write operation are synchronized.Each port has its own data_in, Wr_en,Rd_en,data_out,clock,address. The following table shows pin descriptions for a dual-port RAM with synchronous read (read through) and two clocks. IO pins | Description – | – clk1 | Positive-Edge Write/Primary Read Clock clk2 | Positive-Edge Dual Read Clock wea | Synchronous Write Enable (active High) web | Synchronous Write Enable (active High) add1 | Write/Primary Read Address add2 | Dual Read Address dia | Data Input do1 | Primary Output Port dib | Data Input do2 | Dual Output Port
